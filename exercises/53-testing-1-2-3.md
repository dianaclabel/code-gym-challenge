# Testing 1-2-3

Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples: (Input --> Output)

## Examples:

```
[] --> []
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
  
```

  var number=function(array){
  
  return array.map((letter, index) => `${index + 1}: ${letter}`);
}
  
```
