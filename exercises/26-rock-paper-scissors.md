# Rock paper scissors

ðŸ‘‰[ AquÃ­ encuentras el ejercicio.](https://www.codedex.io/javascript/17-rock-paper-scissors)

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game that resonates with folks from around the world. The rules are as follows:

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
Let's use conditionals, the random number generator, and create a program that simulates the game between the player and the computer!

Begin with a variable, player, and give a 0 to represent a Rock, a 1 to represent Scissors, or a 2 to represent a Paper.

Then use Math.random() to generate a number between 0 and 3 for another computer variable.

Then, use conditionals to compare the values of player and computer to see who wins!

```

Player picked:      Rock
Computer picked:    Scissors

The player won!
